# ⭐️ NestJS Boilerplate (REST API) ⭐️

## Description

This project is a NestJS Boilerplate for building REST APIs.

I'm trying to set up functions and modules that are commonly used when working on side projects.<br/>
Hope this project will be of some help to all developers working on side projects with NestJS Framework.

Also, this project referenced [brocoders's nestjs boilerplate](https://github.com/brocoders/nestjs-boilerplate?tab=readme-ov-file) a lot. (features)
